Most of the variables in the dataset are numeric and floats as they deal with loan amounts, principal, interest and other metrics related to Prosper's yield and estimated returns. The dataset  contains the entire risk profile for the loan, the borrower. Some of the data for unverified income where stated income was less than $1 was removed for uniformity and accuracy.
